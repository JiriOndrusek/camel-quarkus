/**
 * Qualifies a produced {@link dev.langchain4j.rag.RetrievalAugmentor} bean by name.
 *
 * <p>
 * Carried by every produced augmentor that is <em>not</em> the designated default. A bean whose
 * only qualifier is {@code @Named} implicitly also carries {@code @Default} (CDI rule) and would
 * therefore make the unqualified {@code Instance<RetrievalAugmentor>} lookup that Quarkus
 * LangChain4j performs ambiguous — silently disabling RAG application-wide. This real qualifier
 * suppresses the implicit {@code @Default}, leaving exactly one candidate: the designated one.
