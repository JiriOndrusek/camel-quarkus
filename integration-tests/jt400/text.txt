if inquiryTest, i'm gettong as400 creation 77 twice

in simulation only once

real test accesses are trugered by services start (which happens also in simulation)

ConnectionList l308 - real test is in use, simulation not

PoolItemProperties l137 setInUse (real service stets false, but the next validation returns true)

moved consumer stop down and behavior is the same

try without dumpQueries -> it is the first connection #55
