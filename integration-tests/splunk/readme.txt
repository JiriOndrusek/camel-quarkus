when certificates are generated by annotations, I'm getting:

SSL handshake has read 2377 bytes and written 428 bytes
Verification error: self-signed certificate


attempt 2: create and sign certificates by keytool (maven)
combine into a pem
                //openssl pkcs12 -export -out combined.p12 -inkey private.key -in certificate.crt -certfile ca-cert.crt
                //openssl pkcs12 -in combined.p12 -out combined.pem -nodes
test


openssl pkcs12 -export -out combined.p12 -inkey localhost-key.pem -in localhost.pem -certfile splunkca.pem
openssl pkcs12 -in combined.p12 -out combined.pem -nodes



it seems that no encryption is supported by DefaultSplunkConnectionFactory
