to see splunk data in docker container.
Expose port 8000 and access http://127.0.0.1:${exposed_8000)/ in browser.
http://127.0.0.1:32829/en-US/app/search/search

example search: index=testindex sourcetype=testSource | rex field=_raw "Name: (?<name>.*) From: (?<from>.*)"

all indexes: index=* sourcetype=testSource | rex field=_raw "Name: (?<name>.*) From: (?<from>.*)"

TCP events returned with search *, probably because the event contains _raw instead of name
-> first event is ignored?? try use route and map with results as is usuall approach
