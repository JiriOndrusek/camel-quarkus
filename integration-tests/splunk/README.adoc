Splunk UI is helpful for the testing as you can see (and search) fir the data inside splunk. UI is present in the docker image.

Quick way of accessing the UI is to add exposed port 8000 and some thread sleep int the `SplunkTestResource` (to make sure that the container is not closed when the test execution ends)
Use e.g, `docker ps` to obtain the real mapped port for 8000 and access http://127.0.0.1:${exposed_8000)/ in a browser. (the page with search executions is http://127.0.0.1:${exposed_8000)/en-US/app/search/search)
