While you can use any of the available output types in JVM mode, only PDF output type is supported
in native mode. PDF output type in native mode has several limitations:

* Default sRGB color space is disabled because of todo graal issue. This limitation makes configuration property
`disable-srgb-colorspace` ignored. You can see more about sRGB color space in
https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/2.1/configuration.html[FOP configuration].

* If custom fonts are used, font cache has to be disabled because of https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/460[Graal VM issue].
Please use property `<use-cache>false</use-cache>` (more information in https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/2.1/configuration.html[FOP configuration].)

Please file an https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/new[issue] if you are missing some specific output format
in native mode.
