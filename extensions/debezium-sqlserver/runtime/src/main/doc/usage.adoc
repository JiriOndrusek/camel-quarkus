=== Encryption

SQL server may require encryption. In that case `quarkus.ssl.native=false` parameter has to be added during execution.
See https://quarkus.io/guides/native-and-ssl for more details.

=== Integration testing
We can not start SQL container for legal reasons.

To execute integration tests you are required to accept an EULA for SQL container image. Please add file named
`container-license-acceptance.txt` with content `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-CU12` into the test resource
folder (`integration-tests/debezium/src/test/resources`).
