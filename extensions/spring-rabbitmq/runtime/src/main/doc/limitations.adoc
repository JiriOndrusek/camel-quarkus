You can use component without any special configuration in the JVM mode.

In native mode you have to add compiler flag `-H:+InlineBeforeAnalysis`,
to allow removal in static methods (see https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2594[graal issue]).
Component fails without this flag in the native mode.
