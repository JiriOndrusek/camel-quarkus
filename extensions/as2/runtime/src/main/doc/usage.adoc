Depending on its configuration, this component may require SSL encryption on its connections. In such a case, you will need
to add `quarkus.ssl.native=true` to your `application.properties`.
See also https://quarkus.io/guides/native-and-ssl[Quarkus native SSL guide] and xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc[Native mode]
section of Camel Quarkus user guide.

To optimize memory and CPU requirements, the extension needs to know which ciphers and digest will be used at build time.
The digests and cipher names have to be passed via the `quarkus.camel.bouncycastle.digests`,
`quarkus.camel.bouncycastle.asymmetric-ciphers` and/or `quarkus.camel.bouncycastle.symmetric-ciphers` properties. Multiple
values can be separated by comma and values are not case sensitive.
