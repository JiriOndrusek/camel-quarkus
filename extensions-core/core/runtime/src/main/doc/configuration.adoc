=== Simple language

==== Using the OGNL notation
When using the OGNL notation from the simple language, the `camel-quarkus-bean` extension should be used.

For instance, the expression below is accessing the `getAddress()` method on the message body of type `Client`.
[source,java]
---
simple("${body.address}")
---

In such a situation, one should take an additional dependency on the camel-quarkus-bean extension xref:{cq-camel-components}::bean-component.adoc[as described here].
Note that in native mode, some classes may need to be registered for reflection. In the example above, the `Client` class
needs to be link:https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-native-applications-tips#registering-for-reflection[registered for reflection].

==== Using dynamic type resolution in native mode
When dynamically resolving a type from simple expressions like `${mandatoryBodyAs(TYPE)}`, `${type:package.Enum.CONSTANT}` or `${body} is TYPE`, it may be needed to register some classes for reflection manually.

For instance, the simple expressions below is dynamically resolving the type `java.nio.ByteBuffer` at runtime:
[source,java]
---
simple("${body} is 'java.nio.ByteBuffer'")
---

As such, the class `java.nio.ByteBuffer` needs to be link:https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-native-applications-tips#registering-for-reflection[registered for reflection].

==== Using the simple language with classpath resources in native mode
Beyond standard usages, a trick is needed when using the simple language with classpath resources in native mode. In such a situation, one needs to explicitly embed the resources in the native executable by specifying the `include-patterns` option.

For instance, the route below would load a simple script from a classpath resource named _mysimple.txt_:
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").transform().simple("resource:classpath:mysimple.txt");
----

In order to work in native mode the `include-patterns` configuration should be set. For instance, in the `application.properties` file as below :
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.camel.native.resources.include-patterns = *.txt
----

More information about selecting resources for inclusion in the native executable could be found at xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#embedding-resource-in-native-executable[Embedding resource in native executable].

==== Serialization in native mode

Following classes are registered for serialization:

* java.lang.Boolean
* java.lang.Byte
* java.lang.Character
* java.lang.Float
* java.lang.Double
* java.lang.Integer
* java.lang.Long
* java.lang.Number
* java.lang.String
* java.math.BigInteger
* java.util.Date
* java.util.HashMap
* java.util.LinkedHashMap

Developers can configure other classes
for serialization via the serialization configuration file
`-H:SerializationConfigurationResources=/path/to-serialization-config.json` option. For more
information see https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/2730[pull request with feature].
